# Monte Carlo Simulation of Zohran Mamdani’s Policy Proposal  
**A Quantitative Finance Project | Policy Risk Modeling | Fiscal Uncertainty Analysis**

This repository presents a full **Monte Carlo simulation** of the long-term fiscal impact of a policy proposal attributed to New York Assembly Member **Zohran Mamdani**.  
The purpose of the project is *not* political advocacy, but **quantitative skill demonstration** — modeling uncertainty, building simulations, interpreting distributions, and presenting results like a professional quant.

## 🧠 Project Motivation  
Public policy involves uncertainty: economic growth changes, costs fluctuate, and revenue projections often miss real-world outcomes.  
Monte Carlo simulations help us answer:

> **“In 10 years, what is the range of possible economic outcomes of Mamdani’s policy under uncertainty?”**

This project builds a **robust simulation engine** that can test thousands of possible futures and measure:

- fiscal sustainability,  
- deficit risk,  
- revenue variability,  
- cumulative 10-year impact,  
- tail-risk exposure.

## 🔬 What is Monte Carlo Simulation (Explained Simply)  
Monte Carlo = **repeat the future thousands of times** with random variations.

Example:  
If yearly revenue can be anywhere between +2% to –3%, we don’t pick one value.  
Instead we simulate **10,000 possible worlds** and then check:

- What happens most often?  
- What’s the worst case?  
- What’s the best case?  
- How wide is the uncertainty?  
- How big is the deficit risk?

This is how hedge funds, Fortune-500 companies, and government agencies model risk.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
1. Build a **clean financial simulation model** in Python.  
2. Define **revenue**, **cost**, and **economic multiplier** assumptions.  
3. Run **10,000 Monte Carlo simulations** for a 10-year period.  
4. Plot **distributions, histograms, and confidence intervals**.  
5. Interpret the results in a neutral, data-first, professional tone.  
6. Present the full project in a polished GitHub repository.

## 📊 Summary of Results  
After running 10,000 simulations:

- Many outcomes show a **recurring deficit**  
- Some outcomes indicate lower deficit when economic multipliers are higher  
- The histogram displays a **wide distribution**, proving large uncertainty  
- Tail-risk events (worst 5%) are significantly more expensive  
- Best-case scenarios improve only under strong revenue growth  
- Overall, the model highlights that **policy outcomes vary dramatically depending on economic volatility**, reinforcing why Monte Carlo simulations are essential.
